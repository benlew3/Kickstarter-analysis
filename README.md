# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. by looking through various filters, researching what are the current trends and how various kickstarters were either successful or failed.
Based on observations from Great Britian, median goal of the kickstarters was $4,000, which was above the median pledge amount. (See chart 1)
The median pledge amount was just over $1,000, which would lead me to indicate that starting at a lower goal rate has a higher chance of getting funded.

In the US, for plays, the median successful goals was just above $5,000 which was positively fulfilled by pledges around $5,500. From the statistics, as the mean and meadian rise, the likelihood of the kickstarter campaign getting funded decreases. For failed plays in the US, the mean  was over $10,000 which had a pledge mean amount of $559. 

Testing the hypothesis that a higher goal results in a lower pledge rate was shown to have positive correlation on 2 separate tests. US Indie music kick starters also showed a similar correlation that the higher median of failed kickstarters resulted in lower pledge numbers.
