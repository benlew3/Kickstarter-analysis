# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project
To learn about how to use Excel by using data on Kickstarter campaigns and helping to identify how Louise's play's fundraising fared in relation to other Kickstarter campaigns, in particularly in the Theater category.

### Purpose
Identify how Fever's funding campaign compares to other kickstarter campaigns within the Theater venue.

## Analysis and Challenges
Part 1: How does time relate to a successful campaign. Does a particular time improve odds of a successful launch?
From pulling down data on successful vs failed vs canceled theater campaigns, we identified which months had greater success and which months lead to fewer success. 

Part 2:How do goals affect the outcomes of the campaign?
In this section we identify how the set goal amount impacts the percentage of achieving the goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Here we identify that May has the greatest chances of success as a launch date. It also identifies that the later half of the year for a launch date tends to do more poorly.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this chart, it shoes that goal amounts successful and failed are inverse of each other as the goal amount increases. The highest rate of success is at the lower tier, set under $1000, and as it increases between $15,000 and $19,000, the failure rate supersedes the success rate. Again between the $35,000 to $45,999, the success rate of reaching set goals are greater than its failure rate. At the $45,000 mark, it is shown that it has the highest chance of failure. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some difficulties of this data set is its limited knowledge on how the marketing was done per each campaign, how active each campaign was and how many people were involved per the campaigns duration. Additionally it does not grant any insight onto any perks if there was any per each campaign that would pull investors in.

Some additional graphs that would be interesting to identify would be to see if we were able to see if investors were a part of multiple campaigns. We could also see how many campaigns were running against each other during the same time frame. We could look at location based to see if there was a more popular campaign that was taking a majority of the investors.

## Results
The goal set out by Louise had a
